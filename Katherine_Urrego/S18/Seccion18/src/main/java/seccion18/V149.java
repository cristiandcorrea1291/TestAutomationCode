	 DESIGN SELENIUM FRAMEWORK FROM SCRATCH
	 Why framework? -> Its advantages
	 - Create maven structured framework with all necesary automation dependencies
	 - Select sample ecoomerce application to automate end-to-end flow
	 - Implement page object model mechanism to drive the locaroes from perspective clases
	 - Drive object creation within page object clases ENCAPSULATING it from Tests 
	 - Create base test  which sets browser configuration details and GLOBAL PROPERTIES
	 - Decide test strategy, how test shpuld be clubbed & distributed with appropiate annotations
	 - Create TestNG file to trigger test with one singe point of execution conrol
	 - Introduce  grouping in TestNG.xml to categorize test with different tags of execution
	 - Introduce Grouping in TetsNG and Parameterization using TestNG DataProvider HashMap and JSON File Readers
	 - Implement TestNg Listeners to captute Screenshot on automatic test failures and logging
	 - Create Extent Report wrapper to generate excellent HTML reports for the application
	 - Make framework necessary changes to support PARALLEL EXECUTION with Thread safe mechanism
	 - Implement TestNG RETRY MECHANISM to retunr the failed flacky test in the application
	 - Run the framework test wirh Maven commands with TestNG MAVEN INTEGRATION PLUGING
	 - Implement Maven RUN TIME VARIABLES to replace global parameters of test at data run time
	 - Integrate the  framework JENKINS with Parameterized Build Pipeline Jobs & Schedule the jobs on specific time frames
	 - Add CUCUMBER WRAPPER to existing framework with cucumber TestNG Runner
